Hello there!

How to Run the App:

The Main.java is the start of the app. After the app is compiled, the user can see the primary interface.

I use android studio, so I would click "run app", select Nexus 5 API 23 x86 as my emulator, click "ok". Wait a bit and the emulator should launch the app.

When the app starts, the user will see several buttons: Download images, Load Images, Brush, Erase, Clear, and Save.

The Download Images button will load some images from the internet.

The Load Image button will allow the user to chooce a picture as a reference for the painting.

The painting is loaded onto the left side, and the canvas is on the right side.

The Brush button allows the user to choose three brushes. The square brush, the circle brush, and the line brush with variable width based on user's movement of his or her finger.

The Eraser button allows the user to use a soft erase to erase part of the drawing with style!

The Clear button clears the entire painting.

And finally, the Save button saves the painting.

References:
The app was built using the starter code of my professor. The save functionality was a modified version of a colleague's code on discussion. I used the language reference website (developer.android.com) to have a better understanding of the classes, such as the Bimap, Canvas, and Paint. All other parts are built from scratch.

Thanks for Reading!
